# libgpod-node: Native Bindings

Guidance for working on the libgpod N-API bindings. See [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for project overview.

The `@podkit/libgpod-node` package provides N-API bindings to libgpod. While it aims to closely follow libgpod's API, **some operations have enhanced behavior** to handle edge cases that libgpod doesn't address automatically.

## Documentation Requirement

**When modifying libgpod-node native code:**

1. **Document behavioral deviations** - If the binding behaves differently from raw libgpod, document it in:
   - `packages/libgpod-node/README.md` under "Behavioral Deviations from libgpod"
   - Inline comments in the native C++ code explaining the deviation

2. **Explain the "why"** - Include:
   - What libgpod does (or doesn't do)
   - What problems this causes (assertion failures, data corruption, etc.)
   - How our implementation differs
   - Why we can't just use libgpod's default behavior

3. **Add test coverage** - Create integration tests that verify the edge case is handled correctly

## Current Deviations

See `packages/libgpod-node/README.md` for the full list. Key deviations:

| Operation | libgpod Issue | Our Fix |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| `removeTrack()` | Doesn't remove from playlists | Remove from all playlists first |
| `create()` | No master playlist | Create master playlist |
| `clearTrackChapters()` | NULL chapterdata crashes | Create empty chapterdata |
| `replaceTrackFile()` | `copyTrackToDevice()` no-ops if already transferred | Reset `transferred` flag, overwrite file in place |

## Investigating New Issues

When encountering libgpod CRITICAL assertions or unexpected behavior:

1. **Reproduce with a test** - Create an integration test that triggers the issue
2. **Check libgpod source** - Look at `tools/libgpod-macos/build/libgpod-0.8.3/src/`
3. **Understand the expectation** - What does libgpod expect vs. what we're providing?
4. **Fix and document** - Apply the fix and document the deviation
